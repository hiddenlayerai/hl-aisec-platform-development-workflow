## üöÄ Release Status Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the initial release (v1) of the HiddenLayer AI Security Platform Development Workflow repository, consolidating all major features and capabilities.

## ‚ú® Major Features in v1

### üîç Enhanced AI Model Detection
- Integrated `hl-scai` action for comprehensive AI model scanning
- Detects models from all major AI providers
- Provides rich metadata and AI asset inventory
- Sequential matrix execution to avoid rate limits
- Improved extraction logic for various model formats
- Enhanced debug output and error handling

### üê≥ Custom Service Support for Red Teaming
- Test any containerized AI service without requiring Ollama
- Support for private Docker registries with authentication
- Flexible environment variable configuration (different for basic vs AIDR modes)
- Custom health check mechanisms
- Secure secret handling through dedicated parameters

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced AIDR Integration
- Configurable AIDR port (default: 8000)
- OpenAI API support as backend (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Improved secret separation (backend vs AIDR services)
- Custom target URL overrides
- Better environment variable support for AIDR customization
- AIDR-Ollama networking fixes for consistent connectivity

### üåê Configurable Network Mode
- **Bridge Mode (Default)**: Secure container isolation, works everywhere
- **Host Mode (Legacy)**: Available for backward compatibility
- Automatic network creation and cleanup
- Better security by default

### üîß Docker Registry Authentication
- Added `service-registry` and `service-registry-username` inputs
- Added `SERVICE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret for registry passwords
- Implemented Docker login steps before starting custom services
- Comprehensive documentation for various registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, Azure CR, GCR, AWS ECR)

### üìä Docker Log Capture
- Added automatic Docker container log capture before cleanup
- Shows container status table for debugging
- Captures last 200 lines of logs from each container
- Logs displayed in collapsible groups for easy viewing
- Helps troubleshoot container issues and understand test behavior

### üîê AIDR Secret Support
- Added `AIDR_ENV_SECRETS` for passing secrets to AIDR service
- Properly separated backend service secrets from AIDR service secrets
- SERVICE_ENV_SECRETS: Backend secrets for basic mode
- SERVICE_ENV_SECRETS_AIDR: Backend secrets for AIDR mode
- AIDR_ENV_SECRETS: Secrets for AIDR service itself (e.g., OpenAI API keys)

### üåê OpenAI Support with AIDR
- Added support for using OpenAI API as backend when model-provider is "openai"
- AIDR service automatically configures to use https://api.openai.com as backend
- Enables red teaming OpenAI models with AIDR protection
- Added documentation and examples for OpenAI + AIDR configuration

### üß™ Simplified Endpoint Validation
- Completely redesigned `validate-openai-compatible-endpoint` action for simplicity
- Removed all health endpoint checking functionality
- Action now only sends a single OpenAI-compatible request to validate the endpoint
- Made `target-url` required and removed legacy `endpoint` parameter
- All validations are non-blocking (warnings instead of errors)
- Changed default for `test-security` to false (security testing done by red teaming)
- Better focused on its single purpose: OpenAI API compatibility validation

## üìã Technical Improvements

### Testing & Validation
- Added permanent test files in `test/ai_models/`
- Created comprehensive test workflow
- Tests validate both AI detection and HuggingFace extraction
- Robust testing infrastructure

### Error Handling & Debugging
- Better error handling and debugging throughout
- Enhanced error messages and logging
- Improved debug output for troubleshooting

### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation in docs folder
- Custom service guide complete (`docs/CUSTOM_SERVICE_GUIDE.md`)
- Example workflows created for various use cases
- Complete user guides and reference materials

## üöÄ New Capabilities

### Custom Service Testing
```yaml
service-docker-image: "myorg/ai-service:latest"
service-port: "8080"
service-health-command: "curl -f http://localhost:8080/health"
service-env-vars: |
  MODEL_PATH=/models/custom
  LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Private Registry Support
```yaml
service-registry: "myregistry.azurecr.io"
service-registry-username: ${{ vars.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
# In secrets:
SERVICE_REGISTRY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
```

### AIDR with OpenAI
```yaml
model-provider: "openai"
model-name: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
# In secrets:
AIDR_ENV_SECRETS: |
  {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}"
  }
```

- JSON-based secret format
- AIDR configuration with environment variables
- Comprehensive endpoint validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Dependencies
- The `hl-scai` action uses `@main` tag as it's an external dependency without a stable release yet
- All internal references use `@v1` tags

### Environment Considerations
- Default network mode is bridge (secure) but host mode is available when needed
- Bridge mode provides better security and compatibility across environments
- Test thoroughly in your specific environment before using in production

### Configuration Requirements
- `SERVICE_ENV_SECRETS` expects JSON format for environment variables
- Review network mode requirements for your deployment environment
- Endpoint validation focuses on OpenAI compatibility rather than health checks
